        <h3>Page 1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag (77)
                <p>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Switched header tags so h2 is before h3 (29-30)
            </li>
                <p> 
                    The header h2 is larger than h3. For a proper text heirarchy, h2 needs to occur first in the page.
                </p>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag (72)
            </li>
                <p>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </p>
            <li>
                Added document type (1)
            </li>
                <p>
                    Must clarify that an html document is being written.
                </p>
            <li>
                Specified the language of the html file (2)
            </li>
                <p>
                    Specifying the language of the document will prevent various language-based errors and/or warnings to appear in the code.

        <h3>Page 2</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag for the bolded words (26)
            </li>
                <p>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </p>
            <li>
                Fixed error with bold and header tags (52)
            </li>
                <p> 
                    The header tags were placed within the bold tags. Header attributes are not a child of the bold attribute, but the other way around. The bold tags should be within the header tags.
                </p>
            <li>
                Removed the link attribute (56)
            </li>
                <p>
                    The link attribute was not necessary in this situation. Furthermore, it was a fragmented/incomplete link, thus it was invalid.
                </p>
            <li>
                Changed header type for "History" header (76)
                <p>
                    The orginal tag for the "History" header was h6 which was far too small. I changed it to h3 to match the other headers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Swapped header types for "Interior" and "Description" (38,54)
                <p>
                    To maintain a proper text heirarchy, "Description" should be larger than "Interorior" because "Interior" is a subcategory under "Description".
                </p>

        <h3>Page 3</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Changed tags from 'th' to 'td' (79)
            </li>
                <p>
                    The initial tags used for this segment of the code were not appropriate for the content that was being displayed.
                </p>
            <li>
                Moved Lily to the lower 'tr' section (81)
            </li>
            <li>
                Moved "22" to above 'tr' section (92)

            <li>
                Moved "Axelia" to be within the 'tr' tags (96)
            </li>
                <p>
                    All situations where data was moved within tr tags had the same problem.
                </p>
            <li>
                Fixed listing tags (52)
            </li>
                <p>
                    Both the opening and closing tags were either incomplete or missing.
                </p>
            <li>
                Added opening tag to "Axelia"
            </li>

                    The opening tag was either incomplete or missing.

                Added opening and closing tags (42)

                    Both the opening and closing tags were either incomplete or missing.
                </p>
            <li>
                Added alt attributes for all images
            </li>
                <p>
                    All images that are linked must have an alt attribute to provide information about the image in the case that it is unable to load on someone's browser.
