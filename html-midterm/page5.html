        <h3>Page 1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag (77)
                <dd>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Switched header tags so h2 is before h3 (29-30)
                <dd> 
                    The header h2 is larger than h3. For a proper text heirarchy, h2 needs to occur first in the page.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag (72)
                <dd>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added document type (1)
                <dd>
                    Must clarify that an html document is being written.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Specified the language of the html file (2)
                <dd>
                    Specifying the language of the document will prevent various language-based errors and/or warnings to appear in the code.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Rearranged the headers
                <dd>
                    The title of the article should be h1. The credits to the author should be h2. The date should be h3. Proper text heirarchy.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed page title
                <dd>
                    The initial title for the page in the header tags was "Week 3 Assignment" which is inaccurate. I changed it to "Page 1" for consistency.

        <h3>Page 2</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Added appropriate closing tag for the bolded words (26)
                <dd>
                    The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed error with bold and header tags (52)
                <dd> 
                    The header tags were placed within the bold tags. Header attributes are not a child of the bold attribute, but the other way around. The bold tags should be within the header tags.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Removed the link attribute (56)
                <dd>
                    The link attribute was not necessary in this situation. Furthermore, it was a fragmented/incomplete link, thus it was invalid.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed header type for "History" and "Closure" headers (76)
                <dd>
                    The orginal tag for the "History" header was h6 and the "Closure" header was h3. Both of these sizes were too small. I changed both headers to h2 to match the size of the "Description" header.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Swapped header types for "Interior" and "Description" (38,54)
                <dd>
                    To maintain a proper text heirarchy, "Description" should be larger than "Interior" because "Interior" is a subcategory under "Description".
                </dd>

            <li>
                Changed tags from 'th' to 'td' (79)
                <dd>
                    The initial tags used for this segment of the code were not appropriate for the content that was being displayed.

            </li>
            <li>
                Moved Lily to the lower 'tr' section (81)
            </li>
            <li>
                Moved "22" to above 'tr' section (92)
            </li>
            <li>
                Moved "Axelia" to be within the 'tr' tags (96)
                <dd>
                    All situations where data was moved within tr tags had the same problem.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed listing tags (52)
                <dd>
                    Both the opening and closing tags were either incomplete or missing.
                </dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                Added opening tag to "Axelia"

            <li>
                Rearranged the images
                <dd>
                    I rearranged the images so they fit the three different categories.

            <li>
                Added opening and closing tags (42)

            <li>
                Added alt attributes for all images

                    All images that are linked must have an alt attribute to provide information about the image in the case that it is unable to load on someone's browser.
