        <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Added appropriate closing tag (77)</dt>
                <dd>The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.</dd>
            <dt>Switched header tags so h2 is before h3 (29-30)</dt>
                <dd> The header h2 is larger than h3. For a proper text heirarchy, h2 needs to occur first in the page.</dd>
            <dt>Added appropriate closing tag (72)</dt>
                <dd>The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.</dd>
            <dt>Added document type (1)</dt>
                <dd>Must clarify that an html document is being written.</dd>
            <dt>Specified the language of the html file (2)</dt>
                <dd>Specifying the language of the document will prevent various language-based errors and/or warnings to appear in the code.</dd>
            <dt>Rearranged the headers</dt>
                <dd>The title of the article should be h1. The credits to the author should be h2. The date should be h3. Proper text heirarchy.</dd>
            <dt>Changed page title</dt>
                <dd>The initial title for the page in the header tags was "Week 3 Assignment" which is inaccurate. I changed it to "Page 1" for consistency.</dd>

    <div id="page2">
        <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Added appropriate closing tag for the bolded words (26)</dt>
                <dd>The closing tag was either incomplete or missing.</dd>
            <dt>Fixed error with bold and header tags (52)</dt>
                <dd>The header tags were placed within the bold tags. Header attributes are not a child of the bold attribute, but the other way around. The bold tags should be within the header tags.</dd>
            <dt>Removed the link attribute (56)</dt>
                <dd>The link attribute was not necessary in this situation. Furthermore, it was a fragmented/incomplete link, thus it was invalid.</dd>
            <dt>Changed header type for "History" and "Closure" headers (76)</dt>
                <dd>The orginal tag for the "History" header was h6 and the "Closure" header was h3. Both of these sizes were too small. I changed both headers to h2 to match the size of the "Description" header.</dd>
            <dt>Swapped header types for "Interior" and "Description" (38,54)</dt>
                <dd>To maintain a proper text heirarchy, "Description" should be larger than "Interior" because "Interior" is a subcategory under "Description".</dd>
            <dt>Changed the link (42)</dt>
                <dd></dd>

    <div id="page3">
        <h2>Page 3</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Changed tags from 'th' to 'td' (79)</dt>
                <dd>The initial tags used for this segment of the code were not appropriate for the content that was being displayed. The 'th' tag defines the header of a column while the 'td' tag defines the content in a cell.</dd>
            <dt>Moved "Lily" (81)</dt>
            <dt>Moved "22" (92)</dt>
            <dt>Moved "Axelia" (96)</dt>
                <dd>All situations above invovled the moving of data to be within the correct 'tr' tags.</dd>
            <dt>Fixed listing tags (52)</dt>
                <dd>Both the opening and closing tags were either incomplete or missing.</dd>
            <dt>Added opening tag to "Axelia"</dt>
                <dd>The opening tag was either incomplete or missing.</dd>

                <dd>Must clarify that an html document is being written.</dd>
            <dt>Added appropriate closing tag (37)</dt>
                <dd>The closing tag was incomplete or missing.</dd>

                <dd>Both the opening and closing tags were either incomplete or missing.</dd>
            <dt>Added alt attributes for all images</dt>
                <dd>All images that are linked must have an alt attribute to provide information about the image in the case that it is unable to load on someone's browser.</dd>
            <dt>Rearranged the images</dt>
                <dd>I rearranged the images so they fit the three different categories.</dd>
