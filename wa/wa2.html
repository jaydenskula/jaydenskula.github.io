    <h1>Jayden Skuladottir</h1>
    <h2>Creative Technology & Design Student</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Jayden! I use they/them pronouns. I am currently a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in CTD. I grew up in 
        Evergreen, Colorado and attended Evergreen Junior High School prior to coming to Boulder. I have been streaming on Twitch for a couple of years.
        I also make digital artwork and take paid commissions from clients. I have always enjoyed the creative side of technology + computing over 
        the technical side, thus CTD is the perfect fit for me.

        One of my classes this semester is a web development class. My cirriculum for web development is a little backwards. Last Fall, I took a higher
        level class that required all the knowledge that is going to be covered in this course. Even though I am coming into this class with the
        fundamentals (and a bit of extra knowledge), I'm hoping I will be able to explore deeper into some aspects of web development I was not able to
        dig into last semester. In particular, I'm hoping to get more comfortable with Javascript since that was the least-touched-upon topic for me
        last Fall.
